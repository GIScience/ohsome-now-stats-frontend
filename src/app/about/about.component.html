        <p>
            <strong>ohsomeNow Stats</strong> is being developed and provided by HeiGIT (Heidelberg Institute for
            Geoinformation
            Technology) and offers up-to-date and global scale overview statistics on mapping activity in OpenStreetMap
            (OSM).
        </p>
        <p><em>It's not just stats, it's ohsome.</em></p>

        <h2>Data and Statistics</h2>

        <p>Data and statistics are based on data by <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Â©
            OpenStreetMap contributors.</a>
        </p>

        <p>
            The ohsomeNow Stats website allows you to get insights into the number of contributors, total map edits,
            added
            buildings and added road length for a given time range and OSM Changesets hashtag filter. You can use this
            website
            to report mapping statistics for any time range starting from 2009-04-21 when the OSM-API version 0.6
            introduced
            changesets. The numbers you obtain from ohsomeNow Stats get updated in near-realtime. This means that every
            change
            to OSM will be considered by the dashboard a few minutes after the edit has happened in OSM.
        </p>
        <p>
            In order to provide unbiased correct statistics, a combined database is used that contains

            <a href="https://planet.osm.org/planet/full-history/">OSM history data</a> for dates after September 12,

            <a href="https://planet.osm.org/cc-by-sa/">CC-BY-SA 2.0</a> licensed OSM history data for all dates prior to
            September 12, 2012.
